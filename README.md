# Overview
This dataset shows the record of 3 sensors every minutes during 24 hours. 


# Goals
- [x] Work with git and venv.
- [x] Work with TimeSeries (object to datetime conversion)
- [x] Clean Timeseries missing values.
- [x] Visualize TimeSeriees dataset
- [] Perform a statistical study of the datas.

# Repo structure
- gitignore: ignore the venv folder created by the user.
- Readme.md
- requierements.txt: Libraries used in the project. Note that darts have not been used. Not enough data to perform an interesting future prediction.
- sensor_data.csv: datas from Kaggle.
- sensor_data.ipynb: notebook

# Tasks
- [x] Data Analysis/cleaning
- [x] Data Visualization


## Data Analysis/visualization
- [x] Missing values treatments.
- [x] Behaviour of sensors individually/as a group.
